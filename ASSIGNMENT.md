## Game Developer Assignment

Please create a new project from scratch and complete the 3 tasks below.

1. **"Ace of Shadows"**: Create 144 sprites (NOT graphic objects) that are stacked on top of each other like cards in a deck. The top card must cover the bottom card, but not completely. Every 1 second the top card should move to a different stack - the animation of the movement should take 2 seconds.â€‹

2. **"Magic Words"**: Create a system that allows you to combine text and images like custom emojis. Use it to render a dialogue between characters with the data taken from this endpoint: https://private-624120-softgamesassignment.apiary-mock.com/v2/magicwordsâ€‹

3. **"Phoenix Flame"**: Make a particle-effect demo showing a great fire effect. Keep the number of images at max 10 sprites on the screen at the same time.

### Technical requirements:
- â€‹Write your code in TypeScript and use pixi.js (v7) for rendering.
- Each task should be accessed via an in-game menu.
- Render responsively for both mobile and desktop devices.
- Display the fps in the top left corner.
- Run the application in full screen.

We evaluate your project structure, architecture, readability and documentation of your
code. But as game developers we also deeply care about the creativity, visual aesthetics
and playfulness of your solution :)

**Submit your solution within 24 hours.**

Please provide sources in a **git repository** and a **link** to the hosted web version of the **final build**.

All the best ðŸš€
